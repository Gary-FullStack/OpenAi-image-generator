# OpenAi-image-generator
 OpenAi's API and javascript.

 This was a small "how-to"   from teamtreehouse.com.

 Use it how ever you want.



 1.  go to  https://platform.openai.com/     get your self a free api token.  ( Only last 90 days, then ya gotta pay)

 2. take your api secret key and add it to line one in the js file.  ( Remember, ALWAYS secure your secret keys before publishing to the web.)

3.  Open Ai is pretty tame, so don;t ecpect it to work miricles with your requests.



Happy coding !!
